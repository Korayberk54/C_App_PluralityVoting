# C_App_PluralityVoting

This is a program to simulate a Plurality voting type election. This program takes a sequence of votes and the candidates to whom those votes will go to as input, 
and it will output the winner.

*Remember this project was made for cs50's Problem Set. So to run this, you are going to need to download cs50.h library to your system since there is no such a thing 
as "string" keyword in C.*
